tednet - A Toolkit for Tensor Decomposition Networks
=============================================================

``tednet`` is a toolkit for tensor decomposition networks. Tensor decomposition networks are neural networks whose layers are decomposed by tensor decomposition, including CANDECOMP/PARAFAC, Tucker2, Tensor Train, Tensor Ring and so on. For a convenience to do research on it, ``tednet`` provides excellent tools to deal with tensorial networks.
